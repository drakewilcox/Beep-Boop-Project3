## Description

__This web-based program is an excersice in using Arrays and Loops in Javascript. The goal of the project was to create a program that took a numeric input and responded with the results that are specified in the specs listed below. This was acheived by writing a function that replaced digits containing 1,2, and 3 with particular phrases, and also gave priority to particular functions in numbers that contained more than one of the targeted numbers.
